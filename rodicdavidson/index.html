            <h3>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</h3>
            <p>
              Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London
              since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we
              have developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often
              Listed and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and
              experience consistently secure Planning Consents,
              <em>Listed Building Consents</em> and Great Estate Licenses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many areas within central London boroughs were originally
              developed by aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor,
              Cadogan, De Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates
              still own large swathes of, what is now commonly referred to as,
              Prime Central London. These Great Estates maintain significant
              influence either through direct ownership or through various
              stewardship schemes, an example being the Belgrave Estate
              Management Scheme administered by Grosvenor. Schemes such as this
              enable the Estate to exert control over the use, development, and
              appearance of the designated area.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London
              and elsewhere the UK. Through sensitive, contextual design and
              iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have
              established a track record of obtaining difficult planning
              consents for both new-build and existing properties.

            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
            <p>
              We are Rodić Davidson, an award-winning architecture, design, and
              interiors studio with the belief that buildings are more than
              brick and mortar; they are an extension of ourselves and our
              environment. Our practice specializes in design-led and highly
              crafted renovations and new-builds. We pride ourselves on an
              ability to deliver thoughtful and imaginative design whilst
              safeguarding our clients’ commercial interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are and RIBA Chartered Practice based in Bloomsbury, central
              London. Whilst much of our work is local to us in London, the
              practice has an expanding portfolio of work across the UK;
              predominantly in the east and southeast of England but also
              including projects reaching as far as Scotland. We have experience
              working in rural locations, particularly in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent
              and Sussex where we have undertaken a number of farmstead and
              country house projects, for both UK and overseas-based clients.
              These projects often involve sensitive restoration of listed
              buildings, usually with some more contemporary new-build
              additions. The practice seeks to develop sensitive yet ambitious
              design solutions that celebrate heritage while recognizing that
              buildings are often now required to perform different functions
              and should consume less carbon in doing so. In striving for lower
              carbon design solutions, we look to insulate well and integrate
              renewable technologies wherever possible.

            <h3>Our Services</h3>
            <p>
              We offer complete design and management services with an objective
              to always strive to add value through design. Our work is often
              for forward-thinking owner-occupiers and developer clients, where
              we seek to build relationships founded on a personal service,
              creativity and shared ambition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our services include Architecture, Interior Design and Project
              Management. We have a record of obtaining hard-won Planning and
              Listed Building Permissions, working in strict legislative urban
              environments such as The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea,
              London Borough of Camden, and City of Westminster. Outside of
              London we have experience working in National Parks, Areas of
              Outstanding Natural Beauty, Sites of Special Scientific Interest,
              Green Belt and other designated areas.

            <h3>Our Conservation Services</h3>
            <p>
              Much of our work, specifically that in Prime Central London,
              involves the refurbishment, alteration and extension of houses and
              historic buildings that are often Listed. This is often referred
              to as <em>Conservation Architecture</em>. Rodić Davidson have
              experience at working with all grades of Listed Building: whether
              these be Grade 2, Grade 2* or Grade 1.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our design response sometimes looks to introduce modern insertions
              into historic buildings, thereby providing visual separation
              between elements and allowing the historic fabric to be repaired
              using traditional methods and materials. This approach can result
              in clearly articulated functional spaces, allowing appreciation of
              the traditionally proportioned rooms and spaces but also combining
              new, larger spaces with clean crisp lines.

            <h3>Our Project Management Services</h3>
            <p>
              Our practice has forged strong and trusted relationships with a
              wide range of associated professionals and consultants. It is
              these relationships which, in turn, contribute to the planning
              consents and project outcomes that we achieve for our clients. We
              believe in close engagement throughout the design process,
              particularly with Conservation and Design Officers. Our pro-active
              approach is guided by disciplined Project Management principles
              which seek to accurately establish a project programme at the
              outset and identify risk areas.
            </p>
